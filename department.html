                        <h3>Computer-Science</h3>
                        <p>Computer Science Engineering (CSE) is an engineering discipline that covers several topics related to computation, programming languages, program design, computer hardware and software and integrates several fields of computer science. It is one of the trending subjects which students pursue after completing Class 12. CSE is a four-year undergraduate course which involves various aspects needed for the creation of a computer system.Career options in CSE include software developers, hardware engineers, system designers, system analysts, database administrators and more. </p>

                        <h3>Mechanical</h3>
                        <p>Mechanical engineering is the application of the principles and problem-solving techniques of engineering from design to manufacturing to the marketplace for any object. Mechanical engineers analyze their work using the principles of motion, energy, and force—ensuring that designs function safely, efficiently, and reliably, all at a competitive cost.Mechanical engineers make a difference. That's because mechanical engineering careers center on creating technologies to meet human needs.</p>

                        <p>Civil engineering is arguably the oldest engineering discipline. It deals with the built environment and can be dated to the first time someone placed a roof over his or her head or laid a tree trunk across a river to make it easier to get across. They can be found in the aerospace industry, designing jetliners and space stations; in the automotive industry, perfecting the load-carrying capacity of a chassis and improving the crashworthiness of bumpers and doors;.</p>
